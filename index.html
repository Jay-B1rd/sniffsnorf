                    <p>i've created a page for <a href="pages/planets/main.html">electrons and protons, planets and stars</a>! the story still needs to be finished, i've barely evens started it really, but the main page exists now. depending on how the story ends up going i might create individual pages for the chapters like i did for <a href="pages/strongerthan/chapter1.html">you are stronger than you know</a>, but i might also keep it on its own. i'm leaning towards the chapters, since i've already made a folder for it and everything. even if i don't split it into chapters on ao3, i probably will here.</p>
                    <p>i'm also considering making an index of sorts? depending on how many stories i write the side menu might end up getting REALLY big, and i don't want it to clutter everything up. plus it gives me the chance to make a new theme! i really enjoy decorating the websites too much, i'm gonna end up overdoing it, but i do not care, it's fun! oh, and at some point i need to change the theme for electrons and protons. right now it's just the same dark bramble theme from you are stronger than you know. oh, and i still need to make a proper navbar!</p>

                    <p>added <a href="pages/notalone.html">and the universe said you are not alone</a>, complete with its own brand new theme based on gabbro's island! i wonder if there's a way to make the images load faster? i might have to resort to the worst and actually use the webp format. i've heard it's good for load times so i probably should, especially since the images i'm using are just... very large. i'll look into it more, and if i can't use the webp format, i'll find some other alternative.</p>

                    <p>finally, the website is lookin'... ok, maybe not good. it does still kinda look like a baby's first website, but it doesn't look atrocious &#40;i think&#x29;, and it's grown on me, so i'm keeping it. i'd like to make different themes that people can choose from, including one without a background image &#40;or at least a low contrast background image&#x29; so it's easier on the eyes, but i think that's gonna need javascript. plus, i have a project i <em>could</em> be working on. i don't want to, and i don't really have to since it'd be working ahead, but i probably should.</p>

                    <p>uploaded all five chapters of <a href="pages/strongerthan/main.html">you are stronger than you know</a> today, making each chapter its own page for a chapter by chapter version as well as a full version for just the one page. having to change the links for each page individually, as well as other inefficient things, is bound to result in the occasional mistake, but i think for now it's good. plus, i don't have the skills to make it better or for more efficient things. and i'm tired. i could use a nap.</p>
