    Feldspar sits beside their campfire, playing their harmonica like it’s the end of the world. May as well be, as far as they’re concerned. They’re tired of living on centipedes and a choking hope that has been deprived of oxygen for far too long. Their rations have been gone for a long time, and they’re so used to the hunger pains they don’t know what it felt like to live without them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    They play their harmonica, even though they know nobody’s coming. It’s the one thing that gives them hope, the one thing that reminds them of home. They can’t bring themself to leave their camp and visit that jellyfish carcass again, even though it’d give them a view of the stars. So close, yet so far, unreachable to them like they were back on Timber Hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
    Their thoughts are interrupted by the sound of something approaching, and Feldspar forces their tired head to look up. There’s something lighting up the fog, but it’s not bright enough to be one of the anglerfish approaching. Feldspar can’t help the way their hopes soar, and when the Hearthian spaceship breaks through the fog, a grin spreads across their face. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The ship comes to a stop just in front of the skeleton’s teeth, and out of the hatch comes an unfamiliar astronaut suit. Feldspar doesn’t care who it is at this point, they’re about ready to kiss them for finally finding them stranded out here. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Feldspar!” The astronaut yells, and Feldspar hops to their feet. They would recognize that voice anywhere. “I- You’re alive!”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You never were the brightest hatchling, were you?” Feldspar teases. “Congratulations on being the second Hearthian to ever reach Dark Bramble!”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite crashes into them, wrapping their arms around them in a hug that’s too tight for a split second before the hold loosens enough to give them room to breathe. It’s several seconds before Syenite lets them go, taking a step back.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I found the tape recorder you left behind on Giant’s Deep!” Syenite says, and it’s impossible to miss the smile in their voice. “How’d you reach the core?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Giant’s Deep core, huh? Ahhh, that was a wild one. But since you’re asking, I gotta assume you haven’t made it down there yourself, right? If I tell you how, it kinda feels like cheating. Hm... On a <em>completely unrelated note,</em> that sure was a big, hollow vine my ship crashed into. Yep. If I were you, I’d go take a walk and see where it ends. You’ll want to go to the tail end of this anglerfish skeleton here and look for a flickering light in the fog — that’ll be my old ship. Path starts there.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Oh, come <em>on,</em> Feldspar, just tell me!” Syenite huffs, but Feldspar can tell just from the tone of their voice they want to go see for themself more than they want to be handed the answer. The hatchling isn’t even looking at them as they complain, visor pointed directly towards the flashing light.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Take a stroll over there, and if you still haven’t figured it out when you get back, we’ll see how I feel.” Feldspar says.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Deal.” Syenite responds, and then they’re off. They leave their ship behind, using their jetpack to propel themself. Syenite disappears into the fog within moments, and Feldspar sits back down, leaning against the log they’d cut down. They don’t bother with the harmonica, they know Syenite will be back.
    </p>
    <p>
    As they watch the campfire, Feldspar finds themself filled with an energy they haven’t felt in... months, at least. Somebody <em>found</em> them! They don’t know how confident Syenite is in their piloting ability, but the fact they made it through Dark Bramble without getting eaten is proof enough of their skills. Feldspar can remember when they were just a hatchling, only having said a few words since they left the spawning pools, but they looked at Feldspar like they hung up the stars just for them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now they’re in Dark Bramble, of all places, rescuing their old idol. After all the times Feldspar helped Syenite stay out of trouble, it only makes sense it’d be Syenite coming to save them this time.
    </p>
    <p>
    It’s not long before Syenite returns, speeding over towards their camp and landing into a sprint over towards where Feldspar is sitting, just barely stumbling over their feet. “The jellyfish! You can use them to get past the electricity!”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Got it in one, hatchling.” Feldspar says, and they feel a spark of pride, being able to witness Syenite make the connection. They wish they’d been able to see everything leading up to it, but what’s done is done. At least, that’s what Feldspar tells themself.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Do you... want to come with me?” Syenite asks, but they sound hesitant. They look away from the campfire, out at the fog. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hey, I’m in no rush. Frankly, I kinda like it out here. Quiet, peaceful...ish. You’re a little young to understand, but it’s a lot of pressure, being the best that ever was. Been nice to have a break.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite doesn’t look back at Feldspar, staring into the fog like it might tell them something if they stare hard enough. Eventually, they pull their eyes away, even though it seems like it takes a considerable amount of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’ll get you out of here, just— how about a marshmallow first?” Syenite suggests. There’s a cheeriness in their voice that’s clearly fake, but Feldspar doesn’t point it out.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Sounds good to me. Grab me a marshmallow stick too, will you?” Feldspar says, leaning further back against the log and letting themself relax. They used their own marshmallow stick as kindling a long time ago.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar sits up when Syenite pops back out of their ship, the hatchling sitting beside them and handing them the spare stick they grabbed. With the stick and marshmallow in hand, Feldspar leans forward, paying far more attention to the hatchling now sitting beside them than the marshmallow Syenite hands them.
    </p>
    <p>
    “So, fellow astronaut. Tell me about your travels, because I know for a fact Dark Bramble wasn’t the first planet you hopped to. What have you found so far?”
    </p>
    <p>
    There’s something in Syenite’s posture, as they falter for a moment. They stare at Feldspar, and Feldspar goes over the words in their mind—it’s been a while since they had a proper conversation partner, but they don’t <em>think</em> they said anything wrong—when Syenite lets out a small, weak laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m sorry, I’m just- I’m really glad you’re here.” Syenite says, voice soft. “I mean- not <em>here</em> here, not glad you’re in Dark Bramble, I just- I’m glad you’re alive.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m glad to be alive too, hatchling.” Feldspar says, holding the marshmallow stick with one hand and setting the other on Syenite’s shoulder. “Now come on, don’t tell me you’ve come all this way without a few stories to tell around a campfire!”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Ok, but you can’t make fun of me if I’m not as good of a storyteller as you.” Syenite rolls their eyes, lightly nudging Feldspar with their boot. “I visited Ember Twin first, since I heard about a crashed Nomai ship on the surface...”
