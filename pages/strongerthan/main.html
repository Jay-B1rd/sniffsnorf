    Feldspar sits beside their campfire, playing their harmonica like it’s the end of the world. May as well be, as far as they’re concerned. They’re tired of living on centipedes and a choking hope that has been deprived of oxygen for far too long. Their rations have been gone for a long time, and they’re so used to the hunger pains they don’t know what it felt like to live without them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    They play their harmonica, even though they know nobody’s coming. It’s the one thing that gives them hope, the one thing that reminds them of home. They can’t bring themself to leave their camp and visit that jellyfish carcass again, even though it’d give them a view of the stars. So close, yet so far, unreachable to them like they were back on Timber Hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
    At least back on Timber Hearth they had their friends. They had their family. It’s hard to picture their faces now, and their voices are like a faint memory, like echoes across a cavern. Feldspar knows what the voices are saying, though. It’s been the exact same thing since they first crashed in Dark Bramble.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>You should have been more careful. You should have told us where you were going. You could have prevented this.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar lets their harmonica fall from their helmet, though they can still hear the echo of it from the seed growing not far from their camp. It never falls silent, even when it’s been days since Feldspar last played. It’d be comforting if it weren’t for the way it warps the sound, making it uncanny. Familiar in the way a figure standing in shadow is familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
    All of it is just a cycle. Play the harmonica to make yourself feel better, even if it doesn’t work. Try not to think about home. Think about home. Listen to the harmonica coming from the seed. Play your harmonica to drown the alien version of it out. How long has Feldspar been going in circles?
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar lets their brain float away from their body, staring at the campfire as the constant pain of hanging on to life by a thread fades into a background hum. They don’t notice the sound of thrusters slowly growing louder, not until it comes to a stop with the sound of glass cracking.
    </p>
    <p>
    The pilot jumps to their feet, looking up at the sound to see a ship with a damaged cockpit but otherwise whole. Feldspar would recognize Slate’s handiwork anywhere, and for the first time in who knows how long, a grin spreads across Feldspar’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
    The hatch of the ship opens, and Feldspar sees an unfamiliar suit. They’re too tall to be Gossan, but at this point Feldspar is just about ready to grab whoever it is and kiss them anyways.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>“Feldspar?”</em> The astronaut shouts, and as they transition from zero-g to the radius of the gravity crystal, they stumble over their feet, barely catching themself. It’s been so long, but Feldspar recognizes that voice. “You’re alive!”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You never were the brightest hatchling, were you?” Feldspar teases, and it’s so easy to fall back into that familiar banter. It’s like they never left, aside from the hunger pains and atrophied muscles. “Congratulations on being the second Hearthian to ever make it to Dark Bramble!”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite responds by throwing themself into Feldspar’s arms, hugging them tight enough to hurt. They let out a <em>very</em> dignified squeak of pain, and only then did the hatchling’s hold loosen as they pulled back. “I- I heard your harmonica, but I didn’t think- it’s been so long-”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Yeah, that’s right, I’m alive.” Feldspar says, folding their arms over their chest. Hopefully the suit hides how thin they’ve gotten. “Been camping out here since my ship crashed. Violently.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Wait, what?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Oh, this is a good story.” Feldspar rubs their hands together with excitement, gesturing wildly as they tell the story of their daring escape from the massive vines, then the furious Hearthian-eating anglerfish, and then their electrified ship. Syenite is silent almost the entire time, except for the occasional gasp of awe at Feldspar’s stunts. The helmet’s visor was opaque from this side, but Feldspar didn’t need to see the hatchling’s face to know they had the same stars in their eyes they had every time Feldspar would return to Timber Hearth with a new death-defying tale. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “I can’t believe you didn’t die.” Syenite says when Feldspar finishes, a smile in their voice.
    </p>
    <p>
    “You know, in the old days, I used to think the same thing every time I came back from a flight in one piece. These days, I’m used to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite snorts, but then something in their posture falters. They look up at their ship, sparking slightly but mostly unharmed. “I may or may not have been looking where I was going when I was piloting. In my defense, I thought I was gonna find an anglerfish. Well, a <em>living</em> anglerfish.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Ah, I see you’ve gotten familiar with the little beasties.” Feldspar says. There’s something in the way Syenite says it that makes them hesitate, wondering if they weren’t exaggerating, but no pilot worth their salt would be willingly flying blind. Well, except for Feldspar. It’d be hypocritical to chastise them for it, anyways. “Good job avoiding fish food as a career choice so far.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite hesitates, and Feldspar knows they might realize what comes next. They have to find a way out and that means either going through the anglerfish, or trying to squeeze their ship through the hollow vine. Considering the size of Syenite’s ship—significantly bigger than Feldspar’s, Slate did a good job constructing it—Feldspar is leaning towards the former.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m gonna find a way to get you out of here.” Syenite says, voice determined in the same way it was when they said they were going to space after hearing one of Feldspar’s stories. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hey, hatchling, I’m doing alright for myself. No need to rush.” Feldspar says. “I know you probably don’t understand, but it’s nice out here, quiet and peaceful. It’s hard work, being the best there ever was.” It’s a lie, of course. Dark Bramble might be quiet, but it’s far from peaceful.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite has changed since Feldspar disappeared, they know that, it’s just the way time works, but Feldspar still expects for Syenite to roll their eyes and remind them of the fact Feldspar broke their ship beyond repair and Syenite didn’t. They don’t expect to see Syenite’s body tense as they look around the campsite, no doubt taking note of the empty ration cans filled with centipedes.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m gonna find a way to get you out of here.” Syenite repeats, and Feldspar knows there’s no changing their mind. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “How about we have a marshmallow before you go? I’m sure you’ve got dozens of them in your ship.” Feldspar suggests, setting a hand on their shoulder. “One last meal around the campfire before we go rushing back into danger.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite tenses up again, and Feldspar prepares for them to insist on leaving, but then they let their shoulders drop. “Yeah. That sounds nice.” They say, voice slightly weak. Feldspar doesn’t mention it. “I’ll go grab some.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Oh, and a marshmallow stick for me! And repair your ship while you’re at it, or Slate will have your head when we get back.” Feldspar teases.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” The eye roll is audible in Syenite’s voice, but so is the smile that’s returned to their face. Feldspar grins. Mission success.
    </p>
    <p>
    When Syenite comes back out of their ship, sparking repaired and marshmallows in hand, Feldspar sits down beside the campfire, crossing their legs and gesturing for Syenite to join them. Their hatchling takes their place beside them, handing them a marshmallow and a proper marshmallow stick. Feldspar could cry tears of joy at the reminders of home, but they don’t. Instead, they lean forward, giving Syenite their full attention.
    </p>
    <p>
    “So, fellow astronaut. Tell me about your travels, because I know for a fact Dark Bramble wasn’t the first planet you hopped to. What have you found so far?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite giggles, and it’s like they’re back on Timber Hearth and Syenite is a hatchling all over again, telling embellished stories around the campfire. The nostalgia tastes sweeter than any marshmallow ever could. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Ok, well, the first planet I went to was Giant’s Deep, because of this Nomai Statue that Hornfels set up in the museum...”
    </p>

    <p>
    Feldspar sits beside their campfire, playing their harmonica like it’s the end of the world. May as well be, as far as they’re concerned. They’re tired of living on centipedes and a choking hope that has been deprived of oxygen for far too long. Their rations have been gone for a long time, and they’re so used to the hunger pains they don’t know what it felt like to live without them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    They play their harmonica, even though they know nobody’s coming. It’s the one thing that gives them hope, the one thing that reminds them of home. They can’t bring themself to leave their camp and visit that jellyfish carcass again, even though it’d give them a view of the stars. So close, yet so far, unreachable to them like they were back on Timber Hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
    Their thoughts are interrupted by the sound of something approaching, and Feldspar forces their tired head to look up. There’s something lighting up the fog, but it’s not bright enough to be one of the anglerfish approaching. Feldspar can’t help the way their hopes soar, and when the Hearthian spaceship breaks through the fog, a grin spreads across their face. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The ship comes to a stop just in front of the skeleton’s teeth, and out of the hatch comes an unfamiliar astronaut suit. Feldspar doesn’t care who it is at this point, they’re about ready to kiss them for finally finding them stranded out here. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Feldspar!” The astronaut yells, and Feldspar hops to their feet. They would recognize that voice anywhere. “I- You’re alive!”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You never were the brightest hatchling, were you?” Feldspar teases. “Congratulations on being the second Hearthian to ever reach Dark Bramble!”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite crashes into them, wrapping their arms around them in a hug that’s too tight for a split second before the hold loosens enough to give them room to breathe. It’s several seconds before Syenite lets them go, taking a step back.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I found the tape recorder you left behind on Giant’s Deep!” Syenite says, and it’s impossible to miss the smile in their voice. “How’d you reach the core?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Giant’s Deep core, huh? Ahhh, that was a wild one. But since you’re asking, I gotta assume you haven’t made it down there yourself, right? If I tell you how, it kinda feels like cheating. Hm... On a <em>completely unrelated note,</em> that sure was a big, hollow vine my ship crashed into. Yep. If I were you, I’d go take a walk and see where it ends. You’ll want to go to the tail end of this anglerfish skeleton here and look for a flickering light in the fog — that’ll be my old ship. Path starts there.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Oh, come <em>on,</em> Feldspar, just tell me!” Syenite huffs, but Feldspar can tell just from the tone of their voice they want to go see for themself more than they want to be handed the answer. The hatchling isn’t even looking at them as they complain, visor pointed directly towards the flashing light.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Take a stroll over there, and if you still haven’t figured it out when you get back, we’ll see how I feel.” Feldspar says.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Deal.” Syenite responds, and then they’re off. They leave their ship behind, using their jetpack to propel themself. Syenite disappears into the fog within moments, and Feldspar sits back down, leaning against the log they’d cut down. They don’t bother with the harmonica, they know Syenite will be back.
    </p>
    <p>
    As they watch the campfire, Feldspar finds themself filled with an energy they haven’t felt in... months, at least. Somebody <em>found</em> them! They don’t know how confident Syenite is in their piloting ability, but the fact they made it through Dark Bramble without getting eaten is proof enough of their skills. Feldspar can remember when they were just a hatchling, only having said a few words since they left the spawning pools, but they looked at Feldspar like they hung up the stars just for them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now they’re in Dark Bramble, of all places, rescuing their old idol. After all the times Feldspar helped Syenite stay out of trouble, it only makes sense it’d be Syenite coming to save them this time.
    </p>
    <p>
    It’s not long before Syenite returns, speeding over towards their camp and landing into a sprint over towards where Feldspar is sitting, just barely stumbling over their feet. “The jellyfish! You can use them to get past the electricity!”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Got it in one, hatchling.” Feldspar says, and they feel a spark of pride, being able to witness Syenite make the connection. They wish they’d been able to see everything leading up to it, but what’s done is done. At least, that’s what Feldspar tells themself.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Do you... want to come with me?” Syenite asks, but they sound hesitant. They look away from the campfire, out at the fog. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hey, I’m in no rush. Frankly, I kinda like it out here. Quiet, peaceful...ish. You’re a little young to understand, but it’s a lot of pressure, being the best that ever was. Been nice to have a break.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite doesn’t look back at Feldspar, staring into the fog like it might tell them something if they stare hard enough. Eventually, they pull their eyes away, even though it seems like it takes a considerable amount of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’ll get you out of here, just— how about a marshmallow first?” Syenite suggests. There’s a cheeriness in their voice that’s clearly fake, but Feldspar doesn’t point it out.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Sounds good to me. Grab me a marshmallow stick too, will you?” Feldspar says, leaning further back against the log and letting themself relax. They used their own marshmallow stick as kindling a long time ago.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar sits up when Syenite pops back out of their ship, the hatchling sitting beside them and handing them the spare stick they grabbed. With the stick and marshmallow in hand, Feldspar leans forward, paying far more attention to the hatchling now sitting beside them than the marshmallow Syenite hands them.
    </p>
    <p>
    “So, fellow astronaut. Tell me about your travels, because I know for a fact Dark Bramble wasn’t the first planet you hopped to. What have you found so far?”
    </p>
    <p>
    There’s something in Syenite’s posture, as they falter for a moment. They stare at Feldspar, and Feldspar goes over the words in their mind—it’s been a while since they had a proper conversation partner, but they don’t <em>think</em> they said anything wrong—when Syenite lets out a small, weak laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m sorry, I’m just- I’m really glad you’re here.” Syenite says, voice soft. “I mean- not <em>here</em> here, not glad you’re in Dark Bramble, I just- I’m glad you’re alive.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m glad to be alive too, hatchling.” Feldspar says, holding the marshmallow stick with one hand and setting the other on Syenite’s shoulder. “Now come on, don’t tell me you’ve come all this way without a few stories to tell around a campfire!”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Ok, but you can’t make fun of me if I’m not as good of a storyteller as you.” Syenite rolls their eyes, lightly nudging Feldspar with their boot. “I visited Ember Twin first, since I heard about a crashed Nomai ship on the surface...”
    </p>
    <p class="hr">
        —
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar sits beside their campfire, playing their harmonica like it’s the end of the world. May as well be, as far as they’re concerned. They’re tired of living on centipedes and a choking hope that has been deprived of oxygen for far too long. Their rations have been gone for a long time, and they’re so used to the hunger pains they don’t know what it felt like to live without them.
    </p>
    <p>
    The sound of something approaching interrupts their thoughts, and Feldspar raises their head, despite how much effort it takes. They try to shove their hope down, refusing to let it get too high when, for all they know, it could be an anglerfish finally deciding to get curious. Of course, the second a ship breaks through the fog, there’s no point in keeping their hopes low.
    </p>
    <p>
     A grin spreads across Feldspar’s face as they recognize Slate’s signature design. The ship comes to a stop just before the anglerfish’s teeth, and out hops an astronaut wearing an unfamiliar suit. They’re too tall to be Gossan, but Feldspar could kiss them anyways.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar pushes themself up, standing just in time for their mystery savior to land smoothly into the camp and then crash into them with a hug. “Feldspar!” They say, and Feldspar would recognize that voice anywhere. They don’t hesitate a moment longer before they return the hug, wrapping their arms around Syenite.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Nice to see you too, hatchling.” Feldspar says as they both pull away. “They made you an astronaut, I see. And you haven’t blown yourself up yet! Good for you. Congratulations on being the second Hearthian to ever make it to Dark Bramble.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “It’s been a long time.” Syenite responds. “I missed you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Of course you did. Who wouldn’t miss the greatest there ever was?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You won’t be that for long.” Syenite snorts. “While you’ve been stuck in here, <em>I’ve</em> been exploring the solar system. You have no idea how much you missed, Feldspar.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Is that so?” Feldspar cross their arms over their chest. “Well, tell me about how much I could have <em>possibly</em> missed.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite pauses, looking out at the fog. They raise their hand as if to set it on their chin, but the helmet gets in the way. Feldspar stares, waiting for them to say something, and they can see the way Syenite’s body language shifts from cheerful to unsure to afraid. Feldspar has a moment to wonder what they possibly could have found to make them hesitate like that, and they open their mouth to ask, but they don’t get the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’ll tell you back on Timber Hearth.” Syenite says. “We should get you back home.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hey, hatchling, I’m in no rush. I’m doing pretty alright for myself.” Feldspar says, despite the way their suit hangs loose off their thin frame. “I know you don’t understand, but it’s nice out here—”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Feldspar, I’m not an idiot.” Syenite interrupted, voice tense. “You don’t have to pretend everything is okay just because you don’t want to seem weak, or whatever other reason you have. Don’t you want to go back home?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite really has grown since Feldspar saw them last. Of course they have, that’s what happens when you disappear for years. They’ve explored all over the solar system, just like Feldspar, though if what they say can be believed, they’ve seen a lot more of it. They wonder how much of that time was spent hoping for Feldspar to show up.
    </p>
    <p>
    “...I see.” Feldspar says. “You’re right, hatchling. You’re not an idiot. I...”
    </p>
    <p>
    They’ve both changed. The Feldspar of before would never hesitate, not like this, but the Feldspar of before didn’t spend years in solitude with only a skeleton and centipedes for company. They wonder what might have happened to Syenite, to change them like this, when the answer for Feldspar is so blatantly obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
    “We can try to go through the vine.” Syenite says, voice quiet. “See if my ship will fit.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “The...” Feldspar’s face shifts beneath their helmet. “Have you already been to the frozen jellyfish?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite tenses up, the way they always do when they get caught in a lie. Their fists clench and unclench, and Feldspar can tell they’re trying to come up with an explanation for how they know something about a place they’ve never been before. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Yeah. I have.” Syenite eventually says, and all the tension in their body disappears until it looks like they’re going to collapse before Feldspar does. “I know you’re probably wondering how, but it’s a story for when we get back to Timber Hearth.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’ll trust you on this, hatchling. You better not let me down.” Feldspar says. “I suppose we should start packing up camp, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Just make sure you have your harmonica on you.” Syenite responds as they pick up the sleeping bag laying beside the campfire. It’d be difficult to miss the way their voice is filled with relief at not being questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar follows Syenite into their ship, avoiding the very tempting sight of canned rations. It would probably make them sick, anyways. It’s been too long since they had real food.
    </p>
    <p>
    There’s no small amount of pride rising in Feldspar’s chest when Syenite gets their hands on the controls of the ship. They look like they belong there, bulky suit and all, and the ship smoothly flies towards the flashing light of Feldspar’s wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
    The rumble of the thrusters is a comfort after so long in silence. They sit down, lean their head against the wall, trusting Syenite to know what they’re doing. Their eyes close, and they don’t open again until Syenite mutters a curse.
    </p>
    <p>
    They’re inside the vine now, and before them lies the way out of Dark Bramble, into the vacuum of space. The opening is far, far too small. Not even Feldspar’s significantly smaller ship would be able to fit through it.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Damnit.” Syenite growls, letting go of the controls so they can drop their head into their hands. Feldspar forces themself to stand, no matter how exhausted or weak they are, moving closer to the hatchling and setting a hand on their shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
    “We’ll find a way out of here, Syenite. With the two of us together, nothing is gonna keep us down for long.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite lets out a sigh, raising their head a fraction of an inch before finally lifting it enough to look at Feldspar. “You’re right. I’ll— We’ll find a way, somehow.”
    </p>
    <p>
    They grab onto the controls again, carefully maneuvering the ship out of the vine. Feldspar doesn’t move from where they stand in the ship, keeping a hand on Syenite’s shoulder as the pilot brings them back to Feldspar’s camp. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Not feeling up to tackling the anglerfish just yet?” Feldspar asks.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Not quite.” Syenite forces a nervous laugh. “How long has it been since you had a marshmallow?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Too long, hatchling.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Well, I’ve got enough to last a lifetime.” Syenite says, bringing the ship to a stop and unbuckling the safety hardness that Gossan must have finally convinced Slate to add. They grab the marshmallows and the roasting sticks, and then they kick the hatch open, jumping out into the zero gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar follows after them, glancing back at the ship as they float towards their abandoned camp. The Nomai gravity tunnel automatically activates, silently waiting for someone to enter it. Slate was an excellent mechanic, able to work with alien technology in such a unique way. Feldspar couldn’t wait to see them again.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>“Crap, ow—” </em>Syenite hisses, and Feldspar shoots back to the present, stumbling into the gravity crystal’s area of effect as they look over at Syenite. A few logs of the campfire had tumbled over, and it wasn’t hard to guess why as Syenite extinguishes the embers clinging to their suit.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Do you have a first aid kit in your ship?” Feldspar asks, glancing back at where it’s floating in the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
    “No, no— I mean, I <em>do,</em> but I’ve dealt with worse.” Syenite takes a seat in front of the campfire, ignoring their burned boots. “Come on, we don’t have forever.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “What’s got you in such a rush?” Feldspar teases as they follow suit.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Since when have you ever taken your time?” 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Can’t argue with that.” Feldspar takes the marshmallow stick being held out for them, stabbing a marshmallow with it and holding it over the fire. “So, fellow astronaut. Tell me about your travels, because I know for a fact Dark Bramble wasn’t the first planet you hopped to. What have you found so far?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite looks over at them with a sharp inhale, loud enough that Feldspar can hear it through the suit. Their muscles tense like they’re preparing to get hit, and each second of silence that passes is almost painful.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Syenite?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Sorry.” Syenite says, looking away and forcing their muscles to relax. Feldspar can tell it doesn’t work completely. “Just... This reminds me a lot of Timber Hearth. Telling stories around a campfire. I really missed you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m here now, hatchling.” Feldspar says, setting a hand on their shoulder. “Well? I’m not the one with the fun stories anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You could make fishing for hours without catching anything sound fun if you tried, Feldspar.” Feldspar doesn’t have to see their face to know Syenite is rolling their eyes. “Anyways, after I visited Esker on the Attlerock I went to Brittle Hollow, since I wanted to catch up with Riebeck after I found some notes from them...”
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar sits beside their campfire, playing their harmonica like it’s the end of the world. May as well be, as far as they’re concerned. Fortunately for them, the end of the world is interrupted by a ship appearing from the fog, and Feldspar doesn’t even have the time to realize someone else is here before an astronaut pops out and starts collecting their sleeping bag.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Now it’s been a while since I’ve been in polite society, but I think most people start conversations with ‘hello’.” Feldspar says, forcing themself to stand from where they’re sitting. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hello.” The astronaut says. “I’m here to rescue you. We’re getting out of here.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Syenite?” Feldspar recognizes the voice in an instant, even if it’s not nearly as upbeat as they remember it being. “Hold on there, hatchling. I’m in no rush—”
    </p>
    <p>
    “But I am.” Syenite interrupts. “You have your harmonica? Yes? Good.” Syenite grabs Feldspar’s hand, holding their sleeping bag with the other, and then drags them out of the range of the gravity crystal, expertly navigating towards their ship with their jetpack.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I see Slate got the Nomai gravity tunnels to work.” Feldspar says as the hatch closes behind them. Their brain is still lagging behind, but they think they’re doing a good job of pretending to understand everything about what’s happening. “How’d you know where I was?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Your harmonica. I just followed the signal.” Syenite responds. They stare down at the controls, and even though Feldspar is still reeling from the events of the past sixty seconds, they can recognize a nervous hatchling when they see one. “We’re gonna get out of here.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Now slow down there, Syenite. I know I have a reputation, but don’t go getting yourself hurt because you’re too eager.” Neither one of them called out the hypocrisy. “Do you want me to pilot?” Feldspar asks, and Syenite hesitates. Feldspar doesn’t know how much experience they have, but they made it through Dark Bramble without getting eaten, so it’s definitely not zero.
    </p>
    <p>
    “No.” Syenite says.”I can do this. I can do this. Just gotta be careful. Just gotta go fast.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar sets their harmonica on the empty wooden shelf beside the preflight checklight and a pile of marshmallow rations, and then they grab onto the back of the pilot’s seat, wishing Slate had installed a second chair. They’ll take what they can get.
    </p>
    <p>
    “No sweat, hatchling. You’ve got this.” Feldspar says. Syenite nods, and then they finally set their hands on the controls. Even though their nerves are far from gone—Feldspar can tell each breath Syenite takes is very deliberate—their hands don’t shake.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar looks behind them as they leave the skeleton behind, though all they can see is the ship’s computer and the wall it sits in. They’d been stuck there for so long, it feels strange to leave it all behind. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Hopefully they come back for their ship eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite seems to already know how to exit the node they’ve found themself trapped in, racing through the tunnel of fog, but it’d be too easy if that was the end of it. Feldspar isn’t sure how deep they’re trapped in the maze of thorns and roots, but they’re confident in Syenite’s ability.
    </p>
    <p>
    The hatchling hesitates when they meet a wall. They were probably expecting the exit to be here, but that’s alright. “Hey.” Feldspar says, setting a hand on their should. “You’ve got this.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite lets out a long, careful breath. No anglerfish yet. They follow the wall, waiting and hoping for the exit to appear. The silence doesn’t last.
    </p>
    <p>
    They hear a screech, and the sound of something moving through the fog with furious, shrill noises that could only be found in the most dangerous planet in the solar system.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite activates full thrust on the rockets, accelerating as fast as they can, but it’s not fast enough. Feldspar doesn’t need a window in the back to know the anglerfish is closing in—the sound of its shriek rattles the ship itself. Their blood is pumping, but there’s no thrill here, only fear as Feldspar realizes their luck might have finally run out.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar grabs onto the pilot’s seat as tight as they can, flips up the eject cover, and slams down on the button, sending both Feldspar, Syenite, and the front of the cockpit shooting forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite and Feldspar are both panting, eyes wide, hearts racing, but they’re together and the anglerfish is behind them, chasing the other half of Syenite’s ship. The half with Feldspar’s harmonica and all of their equipment. It hurts, but there’s more pressing matters to worry about.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Oh, stars.” Syenite whispers. “I’m so sorry, Feldspar. I- I messed this up. I messed this up <em>bad.</em> I should have—”
    </p>
    <p>
    “It’s alright.” Feldspar cuts them off, setting a hand on Syenite’s shoulder. “We’re not dead yet, right? Don’t give up hope.” In the zero gravity, they use their hand on the astronaut as an anchor, floating to be in front of them and blocking most of their view of the cockpit. They have to remind themself that Syenite won’t hear how hard their heart is beating. “We’re making it out of here, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite responds with a whimper, and they point out the cockpit window. It’s almost comical, the way the universe works sometimes. Feldspar turns to look directly through the glass, and another anglerfish is resting there, enormous and horrifying and unaware of the fact it was in the direct path the fragment of their ship is taking.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite unbuckles themself from the pilot’s seat, and they both wordlessly move into action. Syenite grabs Feldspar’s hand, kicking off the back of the seat to propel the both of them away from the resting beast. Their jetpacks fire as the cockpit impacts with what might be its stomach, and it lets out a howl of fury as it turns towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
    For a moment, Feldspar thinks they might have gotten lucky and the anglerfish is going after the empty ship fragment instead of them. That hope doesn’t last long.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Go!” Feldspar says, but there’s no point. They weren’t able to escape the anglerfish with a ship, and both of them know they stand no chance with just their jetpacks. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite and Feldspar hold onto each other tight, and darkness envelops them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    They only let go of each other when they splash into something that fizzles against their suits, both of them scrambling to stand. The— Well. It’s not a floor beneath them. The <em>stomach lining</em> beneath them is slippery, but Feldspar manages to stand. They swing their head around in the darkness, about to call out for the hatchling, when a flashlight flicks on.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Syenite,” Feldspar takes careful, unsteady steps towards the source of the light. “Come here. We’re okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “No we’re not.” The hatchling gasps. “I’m so sorry Feldspar. You’re gonna die, and it’s all my <em>fault-</em>”
    </p>
    <p>
    “We’re not dead yet.” Feldspar says, and they grab onto Syenite’s hand. The liquid they’re standing in bubbles and pops with each movement, and it’s not hard to guess what the cause of the sound is. They can remember Hornfels mentioning that stomach acid is one of the most powerful acids out there. “We have to find a way out.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Feldspar, we are <em>inside</em> an <em>anglerfish.</em> There <em>is</em> no way out.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hey. If my heart’s still beating, I’m not giving up.” Feldspar tightens their grip on Syenite’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
    “You don’t understand, Feldspar—”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hey. Look at me.” Feldspar says. In the darkness of the anglerfish’s stomach, with only the flashlight for illumination, they grab onto Syenite’s shoulders. They can see through the hatchling’s normally opaque visor, tears falling down their face that won’t have the chance to stain their cheeks before the both of them are dead. “I’m not giving up, and you aren’t either.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite chokes on a sob, and they wrap Feldspar in a hug. Even though Feldspar is shorter and thinner, Syenite hides their visor in Feldspar’s chest, and Feldspar holds them as tight as they can manage with muscles that haven’t been properly used in years. They don’t have any time to be wasting, but Feldspar is at a loss for what to do, because Syenite is right. They can’t get out of this one, and Feldspar knows that, but they can’t let go of that hope.
    </p>
    <p>
    Their thoughts are interrupted by the sound of their helmet latch being undone.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar’s next inhale is a gasp, and they stumble backwards. Hot, humid air presses against their face and then their boots slip and they splash into the stomach acid, only narrowly avoiding swallowing a mouthful of it. It sizzles around the skin of their face and it hurts but it’s nothing compared to seeing Syenite with Feldspar’s helmet in their hands as they choke and gasp for oxygen that isn’t there. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s gonna be okay—” Syenite says, taking a step forward. Feldspar doesn’t hear a single word of it, only registering the fact that Syenite is talking, and Syenite is not who Feldspar thought they were. “This is better, trust me, this is a better death. This is- This is easier than the alternative.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar refuses to sit there and let themself die. They throw themself forward, trying to grab their helmet out of Syenite’s hands, but their movements are clumsy and their grip is weak and even if they weren’t gasping for air Feldspar knows they would never win this fight.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m so sorry Feldspar, I- I can’t let you die like that.” Syenite says as they keep their hold on the helmet tight, barely having to try as they push Feldspar away. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>“Give it back,”</em> Feldspar tries and fails to say, looking up at the astronaut. They can’t see through the hatchling’s visor anymore, not that it matters. Feldspar is terrified of dying. They survived for so long in Dark Bramble, rescued by Syenite, only for it to end here. It’s like the first time they grazed the boundary of space—thrown up by a geyser, so, <em>so</em> close to touching the stars—only for gravity to pull them back down.
    </p>
    <p>
    But now it’s as if the stars themselves pushed Feldspar away. They could have made it. They never could have made it. There was never a way out of Dark Bramble in the first place. It swallows everything and never lets go, and now Feldspar is dying here. Feldspar is <em>dying.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
    They collapse back into the pool of stomach acid below. It burns through their boots, their gloves, their suit, but they don’t feel any of the pain they know they should. There’s still talking, still words being said, but it doesn’t mean anything to them.
    </p>
    <p>
    The last thing Feldspar hears is the hiss of a helmet being removed. 
    </p>
    <p class="hr">
        —
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar sits beside their campfire, playing their harmonica like it’s the end of the world. They pause when they hear the sound of something approaching, looking up to see if one of the anglerfish finally got brave enough to venture over, but it’s not teeth and scales that appear out of the fog. It’s a Hearthian ship, carefully maneuvering towards Feldspar’s camp.
    </p>
    <p>
    An unfamiliar astronaut pops out, and they’re too tall to be Gossan, but Feldspar gets to their feet, about ready to kiss them anyways. They’re the first Hearthian Feldspar has seen aside from themself in who knows how long, and a grin spreads across their face.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Nice to see someone was finally smart enough to follow my signal.” Feldspar says as the astronaut smoothly lands in the makeshift camp. “Congratulations on being the second Hearthian to ever make it to Dark Bramble!”
    </p>
    <p>
    The astronaut stares at Feldspar, eerily still where they stand, and Feldspar starts to worry. The ship was very clearly made with Timber Hearth’s signature pine trees, and the suit they wear is Hearthian, but what if they didn’t understand what Feldspar was  saying? Dark Bramble warped space, who was to say it didn’t warp time, too? But no, that wasn’t possible. If that ship wasn’t Slate’s handiwork, Feldspar would jump into the jaws of an anglerfish.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Say, you doin’ alright there?” Feldspar asks.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Feldspar.” The voice is hoarse, and even though Dark Bramble is always silent, it still takes effort to make out what they say. “You’re okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Of course I’m okay! What kind of pilot would I be if I let a few extradimensional plants with thorns and some giant predatory fish keep me down?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You’re okay.” They say again, and this time Feldspar recognizes the choked voice.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Syenite? They finally made you an astronaut, I see. And you haven’t blown yourself up yet, good for you!” The cheer in their voice is fake, contrasted by the way their legs shake after standing for too long and how devastated Syenite appears even with their face hidden. Feldspar moves towards them, but with every step they take Syenite seems to hunch over, arms wrapping around themself. Feldspar takes deliberate steps to stand in front of them and kneel down, grabbing their helmet and wishing they could hold their face instead. “Hey, hatchling. I’m okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You’re okay,” Syenite gasps again, and they collapse to their knees. Feldspar’s muscles are too atrophied to be of any real use, but they do their best to hold Syenite as the hatchling sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
    “We’re both okay. Nothing’s gonna get us here.” At least, Feldspar doesn’t think so. They’re probably safe, at least for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Sorry, I can- I can do this.” Syenite sniffles, forcing themself to sit up. The transition from sobs to sniffles was sudden, like a snap of the fingers, but Feldspar doesn't push it. “I- I came to rescue you, I just- I was scared-”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You don’t have to explain right now.” Feldspar responds, hand lingering on their shoulder. “Take your time. I’m in not rush.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Well, that’s— No, not- not important.” Syenite stumbles over their words the same way they stumble over their feet as they force themself to stand again. Feldspar follows suit, hesitantly pulling their hand away. “You have your harmonica with you, right?” Syenite asks.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Always.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Good. Good.” Syenite grabs their hand, and pulls them out of reach of the gravity crystal, using their jetpack to navigate towards their ship. Feldspar doesn’t try to stop them, letting the hatchling drag them away from their camp. “I’m sorry for- for that. It’s been so long since I saw you, and I- I thought I’d be able to handle it, but I just— I was wrong.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “No shame in being wrong, hatchling.” Feldspar responds. “I didn’t realize it’d been that long.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “It’s been, um. A while.” Syenite sniffled, letting the gravity tunnel pull both themself and Feldspar up. Feldspar stumbles into the ship, but they catch themself as Syenite buckles themself into the pilot’s seat.
    </p>
    <p>
    “We don’t have to go right now, hatchling.” Feldspar says, moving to hover over their shoulder. “Dark Bramble’s a pretty cozy place to be stranded in, when you get used to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “No it’s not.” Syenite whispers, and Feldspar can’t help but feel like Syenite didn’t mean for them to hear that. “We— I don’t—”
    </p>
    <p>
    “We can go back to the campfire, eat some marshmallows, you can tell me some of your stories—”
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>“No.”</em> Syenite’s voice is almost a growl, and Feldspar pulls their hand back from where they were reaching out to set it on their shoulder. “We are leaving. I know what I’m doing now. I can do it this time.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>This time?</em> Feldspar wants to ask, but they don’t. Syenite sets their hands on the controls, keeping them steady despite the fact they were shaking just moments ago.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar watches as Syenite pilots them out of the first node, letting go of the thrust the second they get through. They stay silent, not because they don’t have anything to say, but because despite the suit, Feldspar can see the tension in every one of Syenite’s muscles, drawn too tight like a rubber band. Anything they say would be at risk of finally making it snap, so they don’t say anything, instead looking between the view outside the cockpit and the death grip Syenite has on the controls. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar clenches their jaw as they get near one of the lights, and the breath of the anglerfish rattles the entire ship. Syenite doesn’t even try to speed up to escape, letting the ship coast, and Feldspar watches through the window as they pass by. Only when they can’t see the massive creature anymore does Feldspar finally connect the dots. They’re <em>blind.</em> Blind, but not deaf. All Feldspar did while trying to escape was attract more of them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Something like a shiver passes down Feldspar’s spine as the ship approaches a wall made of bramble and thorns, keeping them in. They look down at Syenite, wondering if there was a look of despair on the hatchling’s face, but they can’t see anything behind the visor of their helmet. Whatever they’re feeling, Syenite doesn’t look back at them, continuing to pilot the ship and skirting the wall, searching for what Feldspar can only assume to be an exit. 
    </p>
    <p>
    There’s a hitch in Feldspar’s chest as the wall pulls back, revealing a void of fog that could hold anything. Their grip tightens on the pilot’s seat as Syenite accelerates towards it, but there’s no furious screech from behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Fog blocks them from seeing anything beyond a few inches, keeping them blind for what feels like hours but is truly seconds, until it finally dissipates, and...
    </p>
    <p>
    “Why is the sky so empty?” Feldspar asks, voice still quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>“No,”</em> Syenite gasps. They turn the ship towards the sun, and Feldspar can feel their heart stutter in their chest.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Stars above,” Feldspar whispers, leaning forward to get a better view of the red giant in the center of their solar system, a sickly red that threatens to swallow the Hourglass Twins whole.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite’s grip on the controls tightens and they hunch forward, gasping for breaths loud enough that Feldspar can hear them through their helmet. <em>“Fuck.”</em> They hiss, and they finally let go of the controls to drop their head into their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Things sure have changed since I disappeared, haven’t they?” Feldspar asks, unable to tear their eyes away from the swollen sun. The sight reminds them of an infected wound.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Why do I even bother?” Syenite says, voice quiet. “It’s not gonna matter. I don’t know why I tried in the first place.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Woah, there, hatchling.” Feldspar says. “Who told you it wasn’t gonna matter?” They weren’t entirely sure what their hatchling was talking about specifically, but they hoped it wasn’t rescuing Feldspar. The empty sky and bloated sun were... uncomfortable to look at, but they could still get to Timber Hearth. Though, Feldspar would probably be avoiding the museum. Not because of Hornfels, it just... the sun looked a little too similar to the model of the stages of a supernova.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Nobody did.” Syenite mutters. “It’s just how it works. No matter what I do, everything resets, and it was all for nothing. I should have just left you alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Wait, what?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m glad you don’t remember last time I visited.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You visited me before? Hatchling, what’s going on?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m in a time loop.” Syenite sighs. They pull off their helmet, and for the first time in years, Feldspar can see their face. They’re older than they were, but still young, still lacking the scars that typically came with space travel. The intense exhaustion in their expression was so out of place on such a young Hearthian. “Every two hours or so, the sun goes supernova. Everyone dies, and everything resets. According to everyone on Timber Hearth, this is my first time launching. In reality, it’s been... Several dozen?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar stares at them, pulling off their own helmet to get a better look at their face. Syenite practically flinches, and they refuse to meet their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’ve died to the supernova, but I’ve also died to the cyclones on Giant’s Deep, the rising sand on Ember Twin, the ghost matter in the <em>everywhere</em>, the anglerfish in Dark Bramble.” Syenite shudders. “I forgot my suit a few times. Even fell off the launch pad platform once. I’m glad Slate forgot about that one.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hatchling,” Feldspar starts, reaching out a hand to set it on their shoulder. They want to say something, they should say something, but they just don’t know what.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I don’t even know why the time loop is happening.” Syenite huffs, rubbing their face with their gloved hands. “There’s so much I don’t know. I tried to get out of range of the supernova, just to see what would happen, and I still got brought back. I don’t even know if I wish it hadn’t. Part of me just wishes it was over, but...”
    </p>
    <p>
    “But?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “But I need to know.” Syenite says. “I need to know what’s happening, and then maybe I can... I don’t know.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You can’t give up, hatchling.” Feldspar responds. Even the greatest pilot in the solar system feels out of their depth, staring at the look on Syenite’s face, but they tighten the grip on their hatchling’s shoulder just enough to be comforting. “Just because a journey is difficult doesn’t mean it’s not a journey worth taking.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “But what if I can’t fix it?” Syenite whispers. “What if we’re doomed? Shouldn’t I just end it, instead of letting you— instead of letting everyone suffer?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You have to try.” Feldspar’s voice is firm, determined. They sound more resolute than they have since they first said they were going to explore Dark Bramble. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite finally, finally, meets Feldspar’s eyes. “I’m scared.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hasn’t stopped you so far.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    There are tears in their eyes as they laugh, a weak, pained laugh, but still a victory in Feldspar’s eyes. The sound is cut off by a sharp intake of breath at the sound of a rumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
    Both Syenite and Feldspar turn to look at the sun, collapsing in on itself. The death of their star is beautiful. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Syenite,” Feldspar says, turning to meet their eyes again. “I know you can do this. You’re my hatchling, Syenite, and I know you can do this.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m your what?” Syenite gasps as the sun’s collapse comes to a stop. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “You’re my hatchling.” Feldspar repeats over the boom of the explosion. “Me and Gossan, you’re our hatchling.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You’re joking.” Syenite whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Why would I ever joke about that?” They smirk, refusing to turn to look at their impending doom. “Syenite, no matter what you do, no matter what path you take— I’m proud of you.”
