<p>
    Feldspar sits beside their campfire, playing their harmonica like it’s the end of the world. They pause when they hear the sound of something approaching, looking up to see if one of the anglerfish finally got brave enough to venture over, but it’s not teeth and scales that appear out of the fog. It’s a Hearthian ship, carefully maneuvering towards Feldspar’s camp.
    </p>
    <p>
    An unfamiliar astronaut pops out, and they’re too tall to be Gossan, but Feldspar gets to their feet, about ready to kiss them anyways. They’re the first Hearthian Feldspar has seen aside from themself in who knows how long, and a grin spreads across their face.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Nice to see someone was finally smart enough to follow my signal.” Feldspar says as the astronaut smoothly lands in the makeshift camp. “Congratulations on being the second Hearthian to ever make it to Dark Bramble!”
    </p>
    <p>
    The astronaut stares at Feldspar, eerily still where they stand, and Feldspar starts to worry. The ship was very clearly made with Timber Hearth’s signature pine trees, and the suit they wear is Hearthian, but what if they didn’t understand what Feldspar was  saying? Dark Bramble warped space, who was to say it didn’t warp time, too? But no, that wasn’t possible. If that ship wasn’t Slate’s handiwork, Feldspar would jump into the jaws of an anglerfish.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Say, you doin’ alright there?” Feldspar asks.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Feldspar.” The voice is hoarse, and even though Dark Bramble is always silent, it still takes effort to make out what they say. “You’re okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Of course I’m okay! What kind of pilot would I be if I let a few extradimensional plants with thorns and some giant predatory fish keep me down?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You’re okay.” They say again, and this time Feldspar recognizes the choked voice.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Syenite? They finally made you an astronaut, I see. And you haven’t blown yourself up yet, good for you!” The cheer in their voice is fake, contrasted by the way their legs shake after standing for too long and how devastated Syenite appears even with their face hidden. Feldspar moves towards them, but with every step they take Syenite seems to hunch over, arms wrapping around themself. Feldspar takes deliberate steps to stand in front of them and kneel down, grabbing their helmet and wishing they could hold their face instead. “Hey, hatchling. I’m okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You’re okay,” Syenite gasps again, and they collapse to their knees. Feldspar’s muscles are too atrophied to be of any real use, but they do their best to hold Syenite as the hatchling sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
    “We’re both okay. Nothing’s gonna get us here.” At least, Feldspar doesn’t think so. They’re probably safe, at least for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Sorry, I can- I can do this.” Syenite sniffles, forcing themself to sit up. The transition from sobs to sniffles was sudden, like a snap of the fingers, but Feldspar doesn't push it. “I- I came to rescue you, I just- I was scared-”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You don’t have to explain right now.” Feldspar responds, hand lingering on their shoulder. “Take your time. I’m in not rush.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Well, that’s— No, not- not important.” Syenite stumbles over their words the same way they stumble over their feet as they force themself to stand again. Feldspar follows suit, hesitantly pulling their hand away. “You have your harmonica with you, right?” Syenite asks.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Always.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Good. Good.” Syenite grabs their hand, and pulls them out of reach of the gravity crystal, using their jetpack to navigate towards their ship. Feldspar doesn’t try to stop them, letting the hatchling drag them away from their camp. “I’m sorry for- for that. It’s been so long since I saw you, and I- I thought I’d be able to handle it, but I just— I was wrong.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “No shame in being wrong, hatchling.” Feldspar responds. “I didn’t realize it’d been that long.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “It’s been, um. A while.” Syenite sniffled, letting the gravity tunnel pull both themself and Feldspar up. Feldspar stumbles into the ship, but they catch themself as Syenite buckles themself into the pilot’s seat.
    </p>
    <p>
    “We don’t have to go right now, hatchling.” Feldspar says, moving to hover over their shoulder. “Dark Bramble’s a pretty cozy place to be stranded in, when you get used to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “No it’s not.” Syenite whispers, and Feldspar can’t help but feel like Syenite didn’t mean for them to hear that. “We— I don’t—”
    </p>
    <p>
    “We can go back to the campfire, eat some marshmallows, you can tell me some of your stories—”
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>“No.”</em> Syenite’s voice is almost a growl, and Feldspar pulls their hand back from where they were reaching out to set it on their shoulder. “We are leaving. I know what I’m doing now. I can do it this time.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>This time?</em> Feldspar wants to ask, but they don’t. Syenite sets their hands on the controls, keeping them steady despite the fact they were shaking just moments ago.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar watches as Syenite pilots them out of the first node, letting go of the thrust the second they get through. They stay silent, not because they don’t have anything to say, but because despite the suit, Feldspar can see the tension in every one of Syenite’s muscles, drawn too tight like a rubber band. Anything they say would be at risk of finally making it snap, so they don’t say anything, instead looking between the view outside the cockpit and the death grip Syenite has on the controls. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar clenches their jaw as they get near one of the lights, and the breath of the anglerfish rattles the entire ship. Syenite doesn’t even try to speed up to escape, letting the ship coast, and Feldspar watches through the window as they pass by. Only when they can’t see the massive creature anymore does Feldspar finally connect the dots. They’re <em>blind.</em> Blind, but not deaf. All Feldspar did while trying to escape was attract more of them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Something like a shiver passes down Feldspar’s spine as the ship approaches a wall made of bramble and thorns, keeping them in. They look down at Syenite, wondering if there was a look of despair on the hatchling’s face, but they can’t see anything behind the visor of their helmet. Whatever they’re feeling, Syenite doesn’t look back at them, continuing to pilot the ship and skirting the wall, searching for what Feldspar can only assume to be an exit. 
    </p>
    <p>
    There’s a hitch in Feldspar’s chest as the wall pulls back, revealing a void of fog that could hold anything. Their grip tightens on the pilot’s seat as Syenite accelerates towards it, but there’s no furious screech from behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Fog blocks them from seeing anything beyond a few inches, keeping them blind for what feels like hours but is truly seconds, until it finally dissipates, and...
    </p>
    <p>
    “Why is the sky so empty?” Feldspar asks, voice still quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>“No,”</em> Syenite gasps. They turn the ship towards the sun, and Feldspar can feel their heart stutter in their chest.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Stars above,” Feldspar whispers, leaning forward to get a better view of the red giant in the center of their solar system, a sickly red that threatens to swallow the Hourglass Twins whole.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite’s grip on the controls tightens and they hunch forward, gasping for breaths loud enough that Feldspar can hear them through their helmet. <em>“Fuck.”</em> They hiss, and they finally let go of the controls to drop their head into their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Things sure have changed since I disappeared, haven’t they?” Feldspar asks, unable to tear their eyes away from the swollen sun. The sight reminds them of an infected wound.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Why do I even bother?” Syenite says, voice quiet. “It’s not gonna matter. I don’t know why I tried in the first place.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Woah, there, hatchling.” Feldspar says. “Who told you it wasn’t gonna matter?” They weren’t entirely sure what their hatchling was talking about specifically, but they hoped it wasn’t rescuing Feldspar. The empty sky and bloated sun were... uncomfortable to look at, but they could still get to Timber Hearth. Though, Feldspar would probably be avoiding the museum. Not because of Hornfels, it just... the sun looked a little too similar to the model of the stages of a supernova.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Nobody did.” Syenite mutters. “It’s just how it works. No matter what I do, everything resets, and it was all for nothing. I should have just left you alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Wait, what?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m glad you don’t remember last time I visited.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You visited me before? Hatchling, what’s going on?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m in a time loop.” Syenite sighs. They pull off their helmet, and for the first time in years, Feldspar can see their face. They’re older than they were, but still young, still lacking the scars that typically came with space travel. The intense exhaustion in their expression was so out of place on such a young Hearthian. “Every two hours or so, the sun goes supernova. Everyone dies, and everything resets. According to everyone on Timber Hearth, this is my first time launching. In reality, it’s been... Several dozen?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar stares at them, pulling off their own helmet to get a better look at their face. Syenite practically flinches, and they refuse to meet their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’ve died to the supernova, but I’ve also died to the cyclones on Giant’s Deep, the rising sand on Ember Twin, the ghost matter in the <em>everywhere</em>, the anglerfish in Dark Bramble.” Syenite shudders. “I forgot my suit a few times. Even fell off the launch pad platform once. I’m glad Slate forgot about that one.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hatchling,” Feldspar starts, reaching out a hand to set it on their shoulder. They want to say something, they should say something, but they just don’t know what.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I don’t even know why the time loop is happening.” Syenite huffs, rubbing their face with their gloved hands. “There’s so much I don’t know. I tried to get out of range of the supernova, just to see what would happen, and I still got brought back. I don’t even know if I wish it hadn’t. Part of me just wishes it was over, but...”
    </p>
    <p>
    “But?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “But I need to know.” Syenite says. “I need to know what’s happening, and then maybe I can... I don’t know.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You can’t give up, hatchling.” Feldspar responds. Even the greatest pilot in the solar system feels out of their depth, staring at the look on Syenite’s face, but they tighten the grip on their hatchling’s shoulder just enough to be comforting. “Just because a journey is difficult doesn’t mean it’s not a journey worth taking.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “But what if I can’t fix it?” Syenite whispers. “What if we’re doomed? Shouldn’t I just end it, instead of letting you— instead of letting everyone suffer?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You have to try.” Feldspar’s voice is firm, determined. They sound more resolute than they have since they first said they were going to explore Dark Bramble. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite finally, finally, meets Feldspar’s eyes. “I’m scared.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hasn’t stopped you so far.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    There are tears in their eyes as they laugh, a weak, pained laugh, but still a victory in Feldspar’s eyes. The sound is cut off by a sharp intake of breath at the sound of a rumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
    Both Syenite and Feldspar turn to look at the sun, collapsing in on itself. The death of their star is beautiful. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Syenite,” Feldspar says, turning to meet their eyes again. “I know you can do this. You’re my hatchling, Syenite, and I know you can do this.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m your what?” Syenite gasps as the sun’s collapse comes to a stop. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “You’re my hatchling.” Feldspar repeats over the boom of the explosion. “Me and Gossan, you’re our hatchling.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You’re joking.” Syenite whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Why would I ever joke about that?” They smirk, refusing to turn to look at their impending doom. “Syenite, no matter what you do, no matter what path you take— I’m proud of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>“Oh.”</em> Feldspar’s hatchling’s eyes are wide, beginning to fill with new tears that will never get the chance to fall. “I- I won’t let you down.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    “I know you won’t.”
