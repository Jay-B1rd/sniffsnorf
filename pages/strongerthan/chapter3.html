    Feldspar sits beside their campfire, playing their harmonica like it’s the end of the world. May as well be, as far as they’re concerned. They’re tired of living on centipedes and a choking hope that has been deprived of oxygen for far too long. Their rations have been gone for a long time, and they’re so used to the hunger pains they don’t know what it felt like to live without them.
    </p>
    <p>
    The sound of something approaching interrupts their thoughts, and Feldspar raises their head, despite how much effort it takes. They try to shove their hope down, refusing to let it get too high when, for all they know, it could be an anglerfish finally deciding to get curious. Of course, the second a ship breaks through the fog, there’s no point in keeping their hopes low.
    </p>
    <p>
     A grin spreads across Feldspar’s face as they recognize Slate’s signature design. The ship comes to a stop just before the anglerfish’s teeth, and out hops an astronaut wearing an unfamiliar suit. They’re too tall to be Gossan, but Feldspar could kiss them anyways.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar pushes themself up, standing just in time for their mystery savior to land smoothly into the camp and then crash into them with a hug. “Feldspar!” They say, and Feldspar would recognize that voice anywhere. They don’t hesitate a moment longer before they return the hug, wrapping their arms around Syenite.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Nice to see you too, hatchling.” Feldspar says as they both pull away. “They made you an astronaut, I see. And you haven’t blown yourself up yet! Good for you. Congratulations on being the second Hearthian to ever make it to Dark Bramble.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “It’s been a long time.” Syenite responds. “I missed you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Of course you did. Who wouldn’t miss the greatest there ever was?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You won’t be that for long.” Syenite snorts. “While you’ve been stuck in here, <em>I’ve</em> been exploring the solar system. You have no idea how much you missed, Feldspar.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Is that so?” Feldspar cross their arms over their chest. “Well, tell me about how much I could have <em>possibly</em> missed.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite pauses, looking out at the fog. They raise their hand as if to set it on their chin, but the helmet gets in the way. Feldspar stares, waiting for them to say something, and they can see the way Syenite’s body language shifts from cheerful to unsure to afraid. Feldspar has a moment to wonder what they possibly could have found to make them hesitate like that, and they open their mouth to ask, but they don’t get the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’ll tell you back on Timber Hearth.” Syenite says. “We should get you back home.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hey, hatchling, I’m in no rush. I’m doing pretty alright for myself.” Feldspar says, despite the way their suit hangs loose off their thin frame. “I know you don’t understand, but it’s nice out here—”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Feldspar, I’m not an idiot.” Syenite interrupted, voice tense. “You don’t have to pretend everything is okay just because you don’t want to seem weak, or whatever other reason you have. Don’t you want to go back home?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite really has grown since Feldspar saw them last. Of course they have, that’s what happens when you disappear for years. They’ve explored all over the solar system, just like Feldspar, though if what they say can be believed, they’ve seen a lot more of it. They wonder how much of that time was spent hoping for Feldspar to show up.
    </p>
    <p>
    “...I see.” Feldspar says. “You’re right, hatchling. You’re not an idiot. I...”
    </p>
    <p>
    They’ve both changed. The Feldspar of before would never hesitate, not like this, but the Feldspar of before didn’t spend years in solitude with only a skeleton and centipedes for company. They wonder what might have happened to Syenite, to change them like this, when the answer for Feldspar is so blatantly obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
    “We can try to go through the vine.” Syenite says, voice quiet. “See if my ship will fit.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “The...” Feldspar’s face shifts beneath their helmet. “Have you already been to the frozen jellyfish?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite tenses up, the way they always do when they get caught in a lie. Their fists clench and unclench, and Feldspar can tell they’re trying to come up with an explanation for how they know something about a place they’ve never been before. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Yeah. I have.” Syenite eventually says, and all the tension in their body disappears until it looks like they’re going to collapse before Feldspar does. “I know you’re probably wondering how, but it’s a story for when we get back to Timber Hearth.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’ll trust you on this, hatchling. You better not let me down.” Feldspar says. “I suppose we should start packing up camp, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Just make sure you have your harmonica on you.” Syenite responds as they pick up the sleeping bag laying beside the campfire. It’d be difficult to miss the way their voice is filled with relief at not being questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar follows Syenite into their ship, avoiding the very tempting sight of canned rations. It would probably make them sick, anyways. It’s been too long since they had real food.
    </p>
    <p>
    There’s no small amount of pride rising in Feldspar’s chest when Syenite gets their hands on the controls of the ship. They look like they belong there, bulky suit and all, and the ship smoothly flies towards the flashing light of Feldspar’s wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
    The rumble of the thrusters is a comfort after so long in silence. They sit down, lean their head against the wall, trusting Syenite to know what they’re doing. Their eyes close, and they don’t open again until Syenite mutters a curse.
    </p>
    <p>
    They’re inside the vine now, and before them lies the way out of Dark Bramble, into the vacuum of space. The opening is far, far too small. Not even Feldspar’s significantly smaller ship would be able to fit through it.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Damnit.” Syenite growls, letting go of the controls so they can drop their head into their hands. Feldspar forces themself to stand, no matter how exhausted or weak they are, moving closer to the hatchling and setting a hand on their shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
    “We’ll find a way out of here, Syenite. With the two of us together, nothing is gonna keep us down for long.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite lets out a sigh, raising their head a fraction of an inch before finally lifting it enough to look at Feldspar. “You’re right. I’ll— We’ll find a way, somehow.”
    </p>
    <p>
    They grab onto the controls again, carefully maneuvering the ship out of the vine. Feldspar doesn’t move from where they stand in the ship, keeping a hand on Syenite’s shoulder as the pilot brings them back to Feldspar’s camp. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Not feeling up to tackling the anglerfish just yet?” Feldspar asks.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Not quite.” Syenite forces a nervous laugh. “How long has it been since you had a marshmallow?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Too long, hatchling.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Well, I’ve got enough to last a lifetime.” Syenite says, bringing the ship to a stop and unbuckling the safety hardness that Gossan must have finally convinced Slate to add. They grab the marshmallows and the roasting sticks, and then they kick the hatch open, jumping out into the zero gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar follows after them, glancing back at the ship as they float towards their abandoned camp. The Nomai gravity tunnel automatically activates, silently waiting for someone to enter it. Slate was an excellent mechanic, able to work with alien technology in such a unique way. Feldspar couldn’t wait to see them again.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>“Crap, ow—” </em>Syenite hisses, and Feldspar shoots back to the present, stumbling into the gravity crystal’s area of effect as they look over at Syenite. A few logs of the campfire had tumbled over, and it wasn’t hard to guess why as Syenite extinguishes the embers clinging to their suit.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Do you have a first aid kit in your ship?” Feldspar asks, glancing back at where it’s floating in the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
    “No, no— I mean, I <em>do,</em> but I’ve dealt with worse.” Syenite takes a seat in front of the campfire, ignoring their burned boots. “Come on, we don’t have forever.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “What’s got you in such a rush?” Feldspar teases as they follow suit.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Since when have you ever taken your time?” 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Can’t argue with that.” Feldspar takes the marshmallow stick being held out for them, stabbing a marshmallow with it and holding it over the fire. “So, fellow astronaut. Tell me about your travels, because I know for a fact Dark Bramble wasn’t the first planet you hopped to. What have you found so far?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite looks over at them with a sharp inhale, loud enough that Feldspar can hear it through the suit. Their muscles tense like they’re preparing to get hit, and each second of silence that passes is almost painful.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Syenite?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Sorry.” Syenite says, looking away and forcing their muscles to relax. Feldspar can tell it doesn’t work completely. “Just... This reminds me a lot of Timber Hearth. Telling stories around a campfire. I really missed you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m here now, hatchling.” Feldspar says, setting a hand on their shoulder. “Well? I’m not the one with the fun stories anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “You could make fishing for hours without catching anything sound fun if you tried, Feldspar.” Feldspar doesn’t have to see their face to know Syenite is rolling their eyes. “Anyways, after I visited Esker on the Attlerock I went to Brittle Hollow, since I wanted to catch up with Riebeck after I found some notes from them...”
