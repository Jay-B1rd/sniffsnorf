    Feldspar sits beside their campfire, playing their harmonica like it’s the end of the world. May as well be, as far as they’re concerned. Fortunately for them, the end of the world is interrupted by a ship appearing from the fog, and Feldspar doesn’t even have the time to realize someone else is here before an astronaut pops out and starts collecting their sleeping bag.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Now it’s been a while since I’ve been in polite society, but I think most people start conversations with ‘hello’.” Feldspar says, forcing themself to stand from where they’re sitting. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hello.” The astronaut says. “I’m here to rescue you. We’re getting out of here.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Syenite?” Feldspar recognizes the voice in an instant, even if it’s not nearly as upbeat as they remember it being. “Hold on there, hatchling. I’m in no rush—”
    </p>
    <p>
    “But I am.” Syenite interrupts. “You have your harmonica? Yes? Good.” Syenite grabs Feldspar’s hand, holding their sleeping bag with the other, and then drags them out of the range of the gravity crystal, expertly navigating towards their ship with their jetpack.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I see Slate got the Nomai gravity tunnels to work.” Feldspar says as the hatch closes behind them. Their brain is still lagging behind, but they think they’re doing a good job of pretending to understand everything about what’s happening. “How’d you know where I was?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Your harmonica. I just followed the signal.” Syenite responds. They stare down at the controls, and even though Feldspar is still reeling from the events of the past sixty seconds, they can recognize a nervous hatchling when they see one. “We’re gonna get out of here.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Now slow down there, Syenite. I know I have a reputation, but don’t go getting yourself hurt because you’re too eager.” Neither one of them called out the hypocrisy. “Do you want me to pilot?” Feldspar asks, and Syenite hesitates. Feldspar doesn’t know how much experience they have, but they made it through Dark Bramble without getting eaten, so it’s definitely not zero.
    </p>
    <p>
    “No.” Syenite says.”I can do this. I can do this. Just gotta be careful. Just gotta go fast.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar sets their harmonica on the empty wooden shelf beside the preflight checklight and a pile of marshmallow rations, and then they grab onto the back of the pilot’s seat, wishing Slate had installed a second chair. They’ll take what they can get.
    </p>
    <p>
    “No sweat, hatchling. You’ve got this.” Feldspar says. Syenite nods, and then they finally set their hands on the controls. Even though their nerves are far from gone—Feldspar can tell each breath Syenite takes is very deliberate—their hands don’t shake.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar looks behind them as they leave the skeleton behind, though all they can see is the ship’s computer and the wall it sits in. They’d been stuck there for so long, it feels strange to leave it all behind. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Hopefully they come back for their ship eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite seems to already know how to exit the node they’ve found themself trapped in, racing through the tunnel of fog, but it’d be too easy if that was the end of it. Feldspar isn’t sure how deep they’re trapped in the maze of thorns and roots, but they’re confident in Syenite’s ability.
    </p>
    <p>
    The hatchling hesitates when they meet a wall. They were probably expecting the exit to be here, but that’s alright. “Hey.” Feldspar says, setting a hand on their should. “You’ve got this.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite lets out a long, careful breath. No anglerfish yet. They follow the wall, waiting and hoping for the exit to appear. The silence doesn’t last.
    </p>
    <p>
    They hear a screech, and the sound of something moving through the fog with furious, shrill noises that could only be found in the most dangerous planet in the solar system.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite activates full thrust on the rockets, accelerating as fast as they can, but it’s not fast enough. Feldspar doesn’t need a window in the back to know the anglerfish is closing in—the sound of its shriek rattles the ship itself. Their blood is pumping, but there’s no thrill here, only fear as Feldspar realizes their luck might have finally run out.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar grabs onto the pilot’s seat as tight as they can, flips up the eject cover, and slams down on the button, sending both Feldspar, Syenite, and the front of the cockpit shooting forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite and Feldspar are both panting, eyes wide, hearts racing, but they’re together and the anglerfish is behind them, chasing the other half of Syenite’s ship. The half with Feldspar’s harmonica and all of their equipment. It hurts, but there’s more pressing matters to worry about.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Oh, stars.” Syenite whispers. “I’m so sorry, Feldspar. I- I messed this up. I messed this up <em>bad.</em> I should have—”
    </p>
    <p>
    “It’s alright.” Feldspar cuts them off, setting a hand on Syenite’s shoulder. “We’re not dead yet, right? Don’t give up hope.” In the zero gravity, they use their hand on the astronaut as an anchor, floating to be in front of them and blocking most of their view of the cockpit. They have to remind themself that Syenite won’t hear how hard their heart is beating. “We’re making it out of here, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite responds with a whimper, and they point out the cockpit window. It’s almost comical, the way the universe works sometimes. Feldspar turns to look directly through the glass, and another anglerfish is resting there, enormous and horrifying and unaware of the fact it was in the direct path the fragment of their ship is taking.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite unbuckles themself from the pilot’s seat, and they both wordlessly move into action. Syenite grabs Feldspar’s hand, kicking off the back of the seat to propel the both of them away from the resting beast. Their jetpacks fire as the cockpit impacts with what might be its stomach, and it lets out a howl of fury as it turns towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
    For a moment, Feldspar thinks they might have gotten lucky and the anglerfish is going after the empty ship fragment instead of them. That hope doesn’t last long.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Go!” Feldspar says, but there’s no point. They weren’t able to escape the anglerfish with a ship, and both of them know they stand no chance with just their jetpacks. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite and Feldspar hold onto each other tight, and darkness envelops them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    They only let go of each other when they splash into something that fizzles against their suits, both of them scrambling to stand. The— Well. It’s not a floor beneath them. The <em>stomach lining</em> beneath them is slippery, but Feldspar manages to stand. They swing their head around in the darkness, about to call out for the hatchling, when a flashlight flicks on.
    </p>
    <p>
    “Syenite,” Feldspar takes careful, unsteady steps towards the source of the light. “Come here. We’re okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “No we’re not.” The hatchling gasps. “I’m so sorry Feldspar. You’re gonna die, and it’s all my <em>fault-</em>”
    </p>
    <p>
    “We’re not dead yet.” Feldspar says, and they grab onto Syenite’s hand. The liquid they’re standing in bubbles and pops with each movement, and it’s not hard to guess what the cause of the sound is. They can remember Hornfels mentioning that stomach acid is one of the most powerful acids out there. “We have to find a way out.” 
    </p>
    <p>
    “Feldspar, we are <em>inside</em> an <em>anglerfish.</em> There <em>is</em> no way out.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hey. If my heart’s still beating, I’m not giving up.” Feldspar tightens their grip on Syenite’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
    “You don’t understand, Feldspar—”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Hey. Look at me.” Feldspar says. In the darkness of the anglerfish’s stomach, with only the flashlight for illumination, they grab onto Syenite’s shoulders. They can see through the hatchling’s normally opaque visor, tears falling down their face that won’t have the chance to stain their cheeks before the both of them are dead. “I’m not giving up, and you aren’t either.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Syenite chokes on a sob, and they wrap Feldspar in a hug. Even though Feldspar is shorter and thinner, Syenite hides their visor in Feldspar’s chest, and Feldspar holds them as tight as they can manage with muscles that haven’t been properly used in years. They don’t have any time to be wasting, but Feldspar is at a loss for what to do, because Syenite is right. They can’t get out of this one, and Feldspar knows that, but they can’t let go of that hope.
    </p>
    <p>
    Their thoughts are interrupted by the sound of their helmet latch being undone.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar’s next inhale is a gasp, and they stumble backwards. Hot, humid air presses against their face and then their boots slip and they splash into the stomach acid, only narrowly avoiding swallowing a mouthful of it. It sizzles around the skin of their face and it hurts but it’s nothing compared to seeing Syenite with Feldspar’s helmet in their hands as they choke and gasp for oxygen that isn’t there. 
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s gonna be okay—” Syenite says, taking a step forward. Feldspar doesn’t hear a single word of it, only registering the fact that Syenite is talking, and Syenite is not who Feldspar thought they were. “This is better, trust me, this is a better death. This is- This is easier than the alternative.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Feldspar refuses to sit there and let themself die. They throw themself forward, trying to grab their helmet out of Syenite’s hands, but their movements are clumsy and their grip is weak and even if they weren’t gasping for air Feldspar knows they would never win this fight.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m so sorry Feldspar, I- I can’t let you die like that.” Syenite says as they keep their hold on the helmet tight, barely having to try as they push Feldspar away. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>“Give it back,”</em> Feldspar tries and fails to say, looking up at the astronaut. They can’t see through the hatchling’s visor anymore, not that it matters. Feldspar is terrified of dying. They survived for so long in Dark Bramble, rescued by Syenite, only for it to end here. It’s like the first time they grazed the boundary of space—thrown up by a geyser, so, <em>so</em> close to touching the stars—only for gravity to pull them back down.
    </p>
    <p>
    But now it’s as if the stars themselves pushed Feldspar away. They could have made it. They never could have made it. There was never a way out of Dark Bramble in the first place. It swallows everything and never lets go, and now Feldspar is dying here. Feldspar is <em>dying.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
    They collapse back into the pool of stomach acid below. It burns through their boots, their gloves, their suit, but they don’t feel any of the pain they know they should. There’s still talking, still words being said, but it doesn’t mean anything to them.
    </p>
    <p>
    The last thing Feldspar hears is the hiss of a helmet being removed.
