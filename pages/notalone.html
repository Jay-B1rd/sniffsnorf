                <p>
                Time is weird now. Gabbro can remember talking to Chert about time, about the idea of time being a fourth dimension. Three-dimensional creatures could only follow time in a straight line, the way a two-dimensional plane has no concept of up or down. Chert had said that if there was a fourth-dimensional being, they might be able to see time as another direction of travel. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Of course, Chert insisted that was all theoretical. Gabbro couldn’t help but wonder, did the Nomai live in four dimensions? Syenite said the Nomai were the ones who constructed the time loop, did they build it the same way the houses back on Timber Hearth were built? Did they carefully break the fabric of time apart, stitching it back together in a way it wasn’t meant to bend?
                </p>
                <p>
                There was no evidence the Nomai were four-dimensional beings. They had regular, three-dimensional skeletons, and you’d think with less eyes than Hearthians they would be two-dimensional, if anything. (Gabbro could hear the Chert in their head scolding them, insisting that wasn’t how it worked. Yes, Gabbro is aware.) 
                </p>
                <p>
                Still, the Nomai constructed the warp core used in their little scouts, technology none of the Hearthians were even close to inventing. They had gravity crystals and storm shelters and Orbital Probe Cannons and all of it may as well have been magic to the Hearthians that came after. They built a time loop. Ever since it started, Syenite has discovered more about the Nomai than anyone else. Who was to say they didn’t live in four dimensions?
                </p>
                <p>
                “Gabbro.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Gabbro looks away from the sky, letting their arms droop to pull their flute away from their face. Syenite is standing in front of them, arms folded across their chest. “Oh, hey, time buddy. How long you been standing there?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Shut up.” Syenite says. They clamber into the hammock, sending it swinging, and promptly collapse onto Gabbro’s chest. Gabbro lets out a small ‘oof’, but they don’t complain about the sudden weight pressing down. 
                </p>
                <p>
                “You wanna talk about it?” Gabbro asks.
                </p>
                <p>
                “No.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “You got it.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                Gabbro brings their flute back up to play, even if it’s harder to play with the way their lungs are currently being crushed. It’s a mild crushing, they can deal with it. They let Syenite lay there as they play, and as their hammock swings in the wind, Gabbro hopes it’s comforting. They know Syenite isn’t the biggest fan of Giant’s Deep, but that doesn’t seem to stop them from visiting Gabbro. At least, not all the time, it doesn’t. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Gabbro doesn’t stop playing their flute, not even as hear muffled noises from underneath their helmet. It takes them some amount of time, they aren’t sure how long, to realize that Syenite’s shaking. The quiet noises coming from the helmet are the sounds of the astronaut sobbing. Gabbro keeps playing their flute, idly watching at the sky as Syenite cries on top of them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Time continues in a linear fashion, for now. Syenite gets quiet again, though Gabbro can still hear the occasional sniffle. The sky remains dark and cloudy, though not as dark as it gets when the sun is at its smallest, just before the explosion of the supernova. Just a regular, dim light level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                “I reached the center of the Interloper.” Syenite says, voice still shaky. Gabbro pauses in their flute playing, considering the implications of that simple sentence. They doubt Syenite came here to brag.
                </p>
                <p>
                “First Hearthian to land on the Interloper. Nice job.” Gabbro says. “Didn’t know you could go inside.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “There’s a crack on the sunward facing side. It freezes over when it’s far away from the sun, but when it gets close the ice melts and you can go in.” Syenite explains. The way they’re positioned on top of Gabbro means the side of Syenite’s helmet digs into their collarbone. Gabbro doesn’t move. “The Nomai sent a shuttle there to investigate it because they saw some weird energy readings coming from it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “What’d the Nomai find?” Gabbro asks. Syenite doesn’t respond with anything more coherent than a sniffle, so they wait. They’re good at waiting. It’s basically the only thing Gabbro does nowadays, aside from setting up their hammock, playing their flute, and dying repeatedly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                “It was ghost matter.” Syenite eventually says. Their voice shakes, and it’s so quiet Gabbro can barely hear it over the wind. 
                </p>
                <p>
                “Yeah, makes sense. Ghost matter’s across the entire solar system, I guess you’d expect to find it on the Interloper, too.” Gabbro responds.
                </p>
                <p>
                “No.” Syenite says, louder, voice more firm. Still wavering, but better. “There- before the Interloper arrived, there was no ghost matter in the solar system.” They grab one of Gabbro’s hands, holding it to their chest. Gabbro sets their flute on the ground, even though they might as well throw it into the ocean. It’ll be back for the next loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                “So, the Nomai found the source of the ghost matter?” 
                </p>
                <p>
                “You’re not- you’re not understanding what I’m saying.” Syenite says. 
                </p>
                <p>
                “Alright. What are you saying?”
                </p>
                <p>
                Syenite lets out a grumble, bending Gabbro’s fingers. Gabbro doesn’t try to pull their hand away, or insist on a coherent response. Gabbro knows that Syenite will say what they want to say when they’re ready to. Until then, well, Syenite likes to fidget, and apparently Hearthian hands make for good fidget toys. According to Syenite, at least. Though, actually, Syenite might think they make for rather subpar fidget toys, Gabbro hasn’t asked them outright. They just assumed, based on how frequently it happened, but Syenite might just be settling for what they can get in a time loop—
                </p>
                <p>
                “Ghost matter is what killed the Nomai.” Syenite interrupts their thoughts. “It arrived on the Interloper. It was all densely packed, and then when it got close to the sun, it depressurized and covered the solar system in it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Gabbro lets out a hum, placing the hand not currently being held by Syenite on the hatchling’s back. They can feel them shaking again, feel each deliberate breath as Syenite tries to keep themself from crying again. Gabbro can’t see past their visor, but based on the sniffles, they’re pretty sure Syenite fails in that task. 
                </p>
                <p>
                “They all just- all at once, just gone- they didn’t even realize-” Syenite chokes on sobs as they speak, voice breaking. They’re holding Gabbro’s hand too tight, but Gabbro doesn’t pull away. They rub the hatchling’s back, humming the low tune they typically play on their flute. 
                </p>
                <p>
                “It’s just not <em>fair.</em>” Syenite whimpers. “They didn’t deserve to die like that. It’s just not fair.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Gabbro doesn’t say anything. Telling them the universe doesn’t care about being fair isn’t what they need to hear. They probably already know that. If the universe was fair, why would the sun explode on their launch day? Why would they be trapped in this time loop?
                </p>
                <p>
                “They deserved to live.” Syenite sniffled. Their voice is so quiet, Gabbro barely catches the words. “I deserve to live.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Gabbro wraps their free hand around Syenite, holding them as best they can from their position in the hammock. “I know.” They say. “I’m sorry. I know.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Syenite doesn’t say anything, but the way they shake speaks for them. Their grip on Gabbro’s hand loosens, so Gabbro moves to hold them with both arms, knowing it’s the only comfort they can give. Soon, the sun will explode, and take both of them with it. They’ll wake up again, across the solar system from each other, but for now, Gabbro holds Syenite as tight as they can manage as the hatchling mourns a solar system that should have stayed dead a long, long time ago.
