                    <p><a href="notalone.html">and the universe said you are not alone</a> and the main blog page &#40;this one!&#41; have been updated to use scss instead of css. transferring the rest of the pages to scss should be pretty easy with those two done. i think the main one that will give me a challenge is going to be the gallery. the change doesn't do anything from the perspective of someone using the website, but it makes my code way easier to use and modulate or whatever the word is. i'll convert the remaining pages to scss either at home or tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>chapter one of <a href="iloveyou/chapter1.html">and the universe said i love you</a> has been uploaded! it still needs its own unique theme, i have a few different ideas for what i can use, but they're all on my laptop at home. before i do that, i might also work on making all of the css files sass instead. sass makes everything SO much easier, i really need to get started on that.</p>

                    <p>i now have a functioning stories page! the width and stuff of some of it is different from the other pages, it's most noticeable when you compare the background image to the one in the gallery, but that's because of the scrollbar, and there's nothing i can really do about that. if you look closely it's also noticeable in the navbar, but it's more subtle. all i can really do is keep adding content until there IS a scrollbar and then the width will fix itself. guess i gotta get on that.</p>

                    <p>behold. i have added. the navbar. it's actually using the topbar class in the code which just really bothers me but i can't be bothered to change it. if it works it works. i'd like to try modulating my code a little bit more, since there's so much repeating, especially for the story pages. oh, also, i need to make a page with all my stories listed that isn't just the menu badge, but i'm gonna do that later. </p>
                    <p>oh, and i finally figured out my problem with the menu bar! before now, i had to set the height manually, with either a percentage or a &#40;shudder&#41; pixel height. the problem with pixels is it didn't move and stretch with the content, meaning overflow would occur, and the problem with a percentage was... kinda the same, honestly, except i also had to change the percentage each time i added a badge due to the way it works. but now that's been fixed! using the 'fit-content' attribute for height and block-size, it'll just work! i'm really happy with how the website looks, now.</p>

                    <p>i gave in today. i purposefully used the webp format to make the background images load faster. i think i've done something terrible.</p>
                    <p>&#40;but also, the images are huge, and loading times weren't <em>abysmal</em>, really, but they also weren't great. i'd rather just use webp and suffer quietly than make the people using my website wait three seconds for the background image to show up.&#41;</p>
                    <p>because i'm using the webp format, i wanted to make a place where people can get the png versions, plus an area to showcase other screenshots i've taken. thus, the <a href="gallery.html">image gallery</a> has been created! i plan on adding more images as i go, but what i have for now will have to do.</p>

                    <p>i've created a page for <a href="planets/main.html">electrons and protons, planets and stars</a>! the story still needs to be finished, i've barely evens started it really, but the main page exists now. depending on how the story ends up going i might create individual pages for the chapters like i did for <a href="strongerthan/chapter1.html">you are stronger than you know</a>, but i might also keep it on its own. i'm leaning towards the chapters, since i've already made a folder for it and everything. even if i don't split it into chapters on ao3, i probably will here.</p>
                    <p>i'm also considering making an index of sorts? depending on how many stories i write the side menu might end up getting REALLY big, and i don't want it to clutter everything up. plus it gives me the chance to make a new theme! i really enjoy decorating the websites too much, i'm gonna end up overdoing it, but i do not care, it's fun! oh, and at some point i need to change the theme for electrons and protons. right now it's just the same dark bramble theme from you are stronger than you know. oh, and i still need to make a proper navbar!</p>

                    <p>added <a href="notalone.html">and the universe said you are not alone</a>, complete with its own brand new theme based on gabbro's island! i wonder if there's a way to make the images load faster? i might have to resort to the worst and actually use the webp format. i've heard it's good for load times so i probably should, especially since the images i'm using are just... very large. i'll look into it more, and if i can't use the webp format, i'll find some other alternative.</p>

                    <p>finally, the website is lookin'... ok, maybe not good. it does still kinda look like a baby's first website, but it doesn't look atrocious &#40;i think&#x29;, and it's grown on me, so i'm keeping it. i'd like to make different themes that people can choose from, including one without a background image &#40;or at least a low contrast background image&#x29; so it's easier on the eyes, but i think that's gonna need javascript. plus, i have a project i <em>could</em> be working on. i don't want to, and i don't really have to since it'd be working ahead, but i probably should.</p>
